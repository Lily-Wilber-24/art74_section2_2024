        <p>In order to make sure the painting was accurate I used something called gridding for my sketch.
            Gridding is when you draw a grid on an image and then recreate that grid on a larger scale. 
            You then transfer the contents of each individual box from the smaller image to the larger recreation.
            I added some fungi and plants to contribute to the forest spirit look I was going for.
